  <p><em>This is Ben. He is Donkey Kong</em></p>
  <h2>Ben's Background</h2>
  <p>Ben was born at a very young age. He liked to run and play stupid games like Warzone, one of the most terrible games in the history of games. He is mean.</p>
  <h2>Ben's Midlife</h2>
  <p>When Ben was in his 10s-20s, Ben was easily tricked by his friends Liam and Khalijiah. One day, he got so sick of it that he decided to bamboozle them in all of their Warzone games. This made the two so mad that they took his laptop and deleted
    his account. Ben started to fume and then ran all across the world and back in 3 seconds. Both of the bullies were so shocked that they decided to give Ben all of their money.</p>
  <h2>Ben's Billion Years</h2>
  <p>When Ben got all of their money, he decided to get 400 new pairs of running shoes for distance cross country to beat all of the <em><strong>B O O M E R S</strong></em>. This, unfortunately, didn't work and then Ben returned his shoes. Ben
    decided to invest in a hedge fund-like Tom Styer-and about a year later, he got 2 billion dollars. He then decided to become a professional Warzone gamer.</p>
  <h2>Ben's Later Years</h2>
  <p>Ben was getting tired of playing Warzone professionally and making millions of dollars. He wanted to retire and so he did. He gained about 400 million dollars in profit for playing for 25 years. He decided that his life was worthwhile to him and
    so he went on vacation for a few years in the Bahamas.</p>
  <h2>Ben's Last Moments</h2>
  <p>Ben was 201 years old at this point. He had lived his life to the fullest and he had been complacent with his achievements. Sitting on his hospital bed was Cooper, his 4000 year old dog who had grown up to become a professional basketball player
    for the Boston Celtics, the best and worst team known to man (in terms of basketball). His last words were, "Pee pee poo poo..."</p>

  <h3>Net Worth</h3>
  <p>500 Billion Pesos or 26 Million Dollars</p>
  <h4>In Rememberance</h4>
  <p>To remember Ben, burn your old shoes at the Scharr-Weiner Shrine to pay your respects.</p>
